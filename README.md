This is a MATLAB file that attempts to study the computational differences between a DFT, a DTFT and a FFT.

To run this program:
open "eel3135_lab11_skeleton.m" in matlab and run the program
Eventually, a series of plots will show up. And some music will play.

You will eventually see a FFT plot of the music that you just/are listening to.

The song name is "feint operation" from virtua cop 3 by SEGA corporation
